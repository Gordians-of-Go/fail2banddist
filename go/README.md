## Running binaries

* Build the binary
```bash
make build
```
* Run the server
```bash
./server
```
* Run the client
```bash
./client
```

Something like this should be printed on the client side:
```
./client
2024/04/02 22:21:26 INFO Received message message="Hello 0"
2024/04/02 22:21:31 INFO Received message message="Hello 1"
2024/04/02 22:21:36 INFO Received message message="Hello 2"
```
